# Survey Form: My frontend programming

This is an adaptation of the code I had to create to make a project as a requirement to obtain a "Responsive Web Design" certificate through the website: [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive viewer

### What I learned

I learned a lot about how to build an HTML based form. I learned a lot of new elements and practiced a lot of CSS concepts that I used in the last project.

Something I would like to point out is this part of the form:

```html
<form id="survey-form">
            <fieldset>
                <label for="name" id="name-label">Name <input id="name" type="text" x-moz-errormessage="Please specify your name." required></input></label>
```
It makes me proud because I searched the Mdn Web docs about the element and added the necessary attributes.

### Continued development

I want to learn new HTML elements and use javascript more in my projects.
